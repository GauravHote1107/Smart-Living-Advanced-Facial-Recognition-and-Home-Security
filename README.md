# In todayâ€™s world, security is a top priority for individuals and organizations alike. Traditional methods like physical keys and basic passwords often fall short in protecting sensitive areas, creating a growing need for more advanced solutions. Facial recognition technology, with its ability to uniquely identify individuals, has emerged as a powerful tool in enhancing security. 

In this project, we take an innovative approach by replacing traditional two-factor authentication (2FA) with a real-time notification system. When an unknown face is detected, a notification is instantly sent to preset contacts or the property owner, allowing them to lock or unlock the door remotely with a single click. This not only enhances security but also provides greater control and flexibility.

This advanced solution is increasingly vital in a variety of environments, including homes, offices, schools, and colleges. It also integrates features like automated attendance management, reducing manual effort and improving operational efficiency.

As security challenges continue to evolve, this project aims to develop a comprehensive system that leverages facial recognition and smart decision-making notifications to safeguard sensitive areas, ensuring the safety of both people and assets.
